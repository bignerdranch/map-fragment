map-fragment
============

An example of how one can use MapView within a fragment.

The activity-hosting-fragment-library project contains a generic implementation of the workaround (using LocalActivityManager).

The map-fragment project contains an example implementation of using the library project with MapView.

The library project depends on the Android Support Library (v4). In order for it to work with your project, ensure that both projects
are using the same version of the support library jar.
